Problem Statement with the help of chat gpt:

Iâ€™d like a simple online shopping system that I can run on my computer. It should allow users to create accounts and log in with a username and password. 
Once logged in, users should be able to view a list of products, including their names, descriptions, prices, and available quantities. Users should also 
be able to search for products and add them to their shopping cart. The cart should display the selected items, their quantities, and the total price, with
option to remove items.

Additionally, there should be an admin feature to manage products. The admin should be able to add new products 
and remove products from the system. The system should provide clear menus and instructions for both users and the admin, and handle any errors gracefully,
such as trying to purchase more than available stock.
